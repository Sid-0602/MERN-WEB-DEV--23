            <p>
                Margaret Hamilton was a pioneer in computer science and software engineering, whose contributions to the field have had a profound impact on technology and society as a whole. <br> 

             <br><br>As the lead software engineer for NASA's Apollo space program, Hamilton was responsible for developing the software that guided the Apollo spacecraft to the moon and back. Her work was critical to the success of the mission, and her innovative approach to software engineering helped to establish the field as we know it today.

                Hamilton's contributions to computer science were not limited to her work with NASA. She also founded her own software company, Hamilton Technologies, which developed software for a wide range of industries, from finance to healthcare.

                <br> <br>
                Throughout her career, Hamilton was a strong advocate for the importance of software engineering and the need for rigorous testing and verification. She understood the potential risks of software errors and the importance of developing reliable systems that could be trusted to perform critical tasks. <br>

             Hamilton's legacy lives on through her groundbreaking work in software engineering, which continues to influence the development of technology and the field of computer science. Her dedication to innovation and excellence serves as an inspiration to generations of engineers and scientists who seek to push the boundaries of what is possible. <br>

                Margaret Hamilton was truly a pioneer in her field, and her contributions will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come.

                <p>
                    Margaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (n√©e Partington). </p>
                    <p>
                    The family later moved to Michigan,where Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954. She studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College, where her mother was a student; she earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958. <br> <br>
                    She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor. She says her poet father and headmaster grandfather inspired her to include a minor in philosophy in her studies.

                <p>
                    In Boston, Hamilton initially intended to enroll in graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University. However, in mid-1959, Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at MIT.
                    <br> <br>
                     She developed software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC.
                    <br><br>
                    Her work contributed to Lorenz's publications on chaos theory. At the time, computer science and software engineering were not yet established disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience. She moved on to another project in the summer of 1961, and hired and trained Ellen Fetter as her replacement.

                <p>
                    
                    When Hamilton started using the term "software engineering" during the early Apollo missions, software development was not taken seriously compared to other engineering, nor was it regarded as a science. 
                    <br><br>Hamilton was concerned with legitimizing software development as an engineering discipline. Over time the term "software engineering" gained the same respect as any other technical discipline.<br><br> The IEEE Software September/October 2018 issue celebrates the 50th anniversary of software engineering. Hamilton talks about "Errors" and how they influenced her work related to software engineering and how her language, USL, could be used to prevent the majority of "Errors" in a system. Writing in Wired, Robert McMillan noted: "At MIT she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer". Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting humans to the Moon. 
                    
                </p><p>According to Wired's Karen Tegan Padir: "She, along with that other early programming pioneer, COBOL inventor Grace Hopper, also deserve tremendous credit for helping to open the door for more women to enter and succeed in STEM fields like software."

                    In 2019, to celebrate 50 years to the Apollo landing, Google decided to make a tribute to Hamilton. The mirrors at the Ivanpah plant were configured to create a picture of Hamilton and the Apollo 11 by moonlight.
